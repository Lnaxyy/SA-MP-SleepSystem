# Sleep System
Scripts for GTA: SA-MP

The Script is a system designed to make the player feel sleepy. If he does not sleep will end up sleeping on the street (or wherever you are), the screen will flash convey the effect of the character's eyes flickering caused by fatigue.


When the player get to level 5 sleep (maximum ProgressBar), he will be at the highest level of sleep.


If the character is generally put to sleep, causing the control command '/ sleep', the level of sleep back to 0, but if he falls asleep at the location finding will reduce to 3.



Command: /sleep - for when the player is sleepy.
